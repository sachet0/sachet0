## ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!
Hello, I am Sachet. Currently a 2nd year Computer Science ðŸ’» student. 

I like to work with computers both in terms of hardware and software but software is my main focus.
My interests include Artificial intelligence but have yet to dive into it. I am still discovering new things about the world and learning all the time.

## ðŸ§¾ Languages and skills
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- Linux

I am currently learning C and C++ as I have heard alot of great things about them.

## ðŸ’» Softwares that I like to use
I like using **Visual Studio Code** as it is a great extensible text editor with many extensions that can make it like an IDE. I also like to use **VIM** text editor while I am on the terminal.
